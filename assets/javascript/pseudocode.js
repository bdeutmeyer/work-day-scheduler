//Display today's date via day.js
//Create timeblocks for 9-5 for input in HTML
//Functionality for save button
    //add event listener - needs to be able to store and remove input from localStorage - if localstorage is '', clear
//Time blocks need to know what time and date it is via dayjs so that they can automatically color code - some sort of timer function
    //timer loops through blocks, uses conditionals to decide what color it should be - classes/change classes to change color
//On page refresh/reload, anything in local storage needs to be rendered to the correct hour
