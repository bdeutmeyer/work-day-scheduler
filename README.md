# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application is a simple work day scheduler. It displays the current day at the top of the page, and contains individual time blocks for the 9:00-5:00 hours. Each hour is color coded based on the current time. Past hours are gray, the current hour is red, and future hours are green. Users can type schedule details into each time block and save it using the save button so that that information remains present upon page refresh. Users can also delete the text out of time blocks by clicking the save button after deleting the text in the box.

## Technologies used

My part of this assignment used JavaScript, jQuery, the day.js library, and HTML. The application also utilizes CSS, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts.

## Credits

Starter code was provided for this assignment, which included the beginnings of the HTML file (boilerplate, CDN links, links to connected local files, and structure examples), the CSS file (entire), and JavaScript file (enclosing jQuery call and "TODO" comments). I gained guidance and syntax ideas from my TA Dom Spadafora, ChatGPT, and numerous articles and pieces of documentation found via Google search, but the code structure as utilized here is mine.
